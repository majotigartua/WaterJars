# Jarras
There are three jugs with capacities of 8 liters, 5 liters and 3 liters. At the start of the computer program, the 8-liter jar is completely full and the other two are empty. At the end of the software run, there should be 4 liters in the 8-liter jug, regardless of the contents of the other jugs.
